Reporting delays

A4T reporting: latency is generally the same as your other visit based AA data (typically about 45 min). It can be even slower initially for a brand new activity.

Target reporting: latency is usually less than four minutes. If it hasn't loaded within four minutes I'd expect that something is wrong with the implementation. Can you verify the click event fired a request to Target? Was the metric defined correctly? Were you use "clicked an element" or "viewed an mbox/location"?
